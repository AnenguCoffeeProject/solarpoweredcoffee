  <blockquote>
    Hi! My name is Guy Dwyer, and either we've met in real life or someone has told you about the Anengu Coffee Project in Papua New Guinea
  </blockquote>

  <p> If I haven't already talked to you about the coffee project and if you haven't read the backstory, <a href="#theBackstory" class="smoothScroll">click here</a>! It's a fairly lengthy read, but it gives what I’ve written directly below some context and would be worth reading first.</p>

  <section id="solarPoweredCoffee">

    <h2>Solar Powered Coffee</h2>

    <p>I'd like to say thanks to everyone who has had input into the solar project idea that I am about to share. I'd also like to say an even bigger thank you to those who have already become supporters. It's time to put it out there and see if we can get this off the ground!</p>

    <img src="/images/3.jpg" class="pull-left" alt="The Anengu Coffee Project: Solar Powered Coffee" />

    <p>Rather than letting you read through a long article then ambushing you at the end, I’ll be upfront and let you know that this is a request for your help with the coffee project. I’ll give a short proposal encompassing what I would like to do and how you might help. If you’re still interested, I will explain the details and the rationale later in the article.</p>

    <blockquote>
      I see this project as not only a way to help the village of Anengu, but also an opportunity for the village to build a better community. If successful, it may become an example for other highland villages in PNG.
    </blockquote>

    <p>First of all I would like to ask for donations of no longer used but functional laptops. These will be used to keep records of the project meetings and finances, which in turn will teach the villagers simple business skills. The laptops will also be used for email communication with Wilson so he can monitor the day-to-day running of the project whilst he is away on government work.</p>

    <p><em>[Not sure who Wilson is? <a href="#theBackstory" class="smoothScroll">Read the backstory</a>, and all will be made clear!]</em></p>

    <p>Secondly, I would like to raise $3000 in the form of <strong>interest free LOANS</strong> from you, the 'Anengu supporters'. The loans will be used to buy a small solar panel, battery, and mains power inverter system, plus some basic tools to install and maintain the system. My plan is to travel to the village to install the system in August/September 2017 (this will be at my own expense, not from any loan money).</p>

    <img src="/images/3.jpg" class="pull-right" alt="The Anengu Coffee Project: Solar Powered Coffee" />

    <p>Along with providing a constant clean energy source to run the laptops and some LED lighting in the project headquarters, the excess power will be used to run a user-pays Mobile Phone Charging Station. The proceeds of the charging station will be used to pay back the loans. It will also be a very good way to introduce the project members to basic record keeping, business finance and using bank accounts.</p>

    <p>As the loans are interest free, there is no time period attached to their repayment. Each time one third of the total loan amount is collected from the charging station fees, an email will be sent to all Anengu supporters asking if they would like that portion of their loan returned, or alternatively, if they would be prefer to roll it back into the project. Money rolled back in would help the project expand until the project members are able to manage without external funding.</p>

    <p>If you decide to make a loan, it must be understood that there is absolutely no guarantee your money will be returned. This is a completely experimental idea, without any government or NGO involvement. It is totally owned and driven by the villagers. They have never been involved in anything like this before, and as such, they may not succeed, and your money may be lost. Regardless, you should be satisfied that you gave people less fortunate an opportunity to sustainably improve their standard of living.</p>

    <img src="/images/3.jpg" alt="The Anengu Coffee Project: Solar Powered Coffee" />

    <p>Thanks for reading. I really hope, with a bit of help from all of you, the people of Anengu can learn the skills they need to make real changes in their lives. If you like the concept and you’re interested in loaning any amount, whether it be $5 or $100, it will all be of help to the project.</p>

    <blockquote class="pull-left">
      If you think you know somebody that might be interested in the story, or better still, becoming a supporter, please forward them this website.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Please make any loans as soon as possible so that me and the villagers can start planning for 2017. Only Wilson knows of this plan so far, so if the $3000 needed to kick things off isn’t raised, I will return all of the money loaned without any disappointment to the villagers.</p>

  <section id="theRationale">

    <hr />

    <h2>The Rationale Behind The Approach</h2>

    <p>One of the first things you may be wondering is why we have decided to take loans and not donations. Wilson and I are against unconditional handouts. Just giving people money goes against everything the project is about. We want the project members to make the connection between putting energy in, to then get something out. After a lot of thought about ways I could help the project and a few emails back and forward with Wilson, it seemed this plan would satisfy numerous key needs while keeping with the spirit of the project. By making it a loan the project members will understand it is not a handout. They must work to pay it back and in the process learn skills useful to the project so they can eventually manage it on their own.</p>

    <p>When I first became involved in the project it was already well under way. The project is by no means my own to direct. It is solely owned and driven by the villagers. All I can do is offer my opinions and advice and let them decide whether they think it worthwhile. Wilson and I share the dream of teaching his people how to help themselves, and we fortunately share a similar vision of how we think the project should progress. Although this email asks for financial loans for the project, I am just as much asking for your support of the concept. The project’s main purpose is not to fulfill community aims, it is to teach people how to fulfill aims. That way the villagers can fulfill broader aims throughout their entire lives independent of Wilson, myself or the project. Fulfillment of aims is a by-product of a successful project. We are teaching people how to fish.</p>

    <p>One of my greatest fears is, if successful, the project will bring substantial amounts of money into an otherwise virtually moneyless society. Without some guidance, the villagers will be walking straight into the trap of glitzy but trashy consumer goods and consumer attitudes that, along with inevitably polluting their surroundings, will just as harmfully pollute their culture and mentality.</p>

    <p>The last thing I want to see the project do is stifle creativity, innovation and individuality the way collectivism and total equality does. Nor do I want to see the project create the rampant selfishness, greed and nasty competitiveness that completely profit-motivated capitalism does. There must be a middle way.</p>

    <p>Total equality is a myth. People are infinitely varied, thus have infinitely varying abilities. I believe the brightest and hardest working members of the village should be rewarded for their ability and effort with a little extra material wealth. However, I would also like to see the real measure of an individual’s success, in their own eyes and the eyes of the rest of the village, based on how many fellow project members they can lift up alongside themselves. In other words, despite all the varied abilities of the villagers, the measure of the best among them should be evident in the level of equality in the entire village.</p>

    <p>Anengu has an almost clean slate to build themselves a more developed community. A community that values their culture, their environment and their freedom. A community with the most basic services we take for granted like heath care, electricity, education and sanitation. With snippets from TV and mobile phones, they have only the narrowest concept of the developed world. In terms of development, we are already at the point they are trying to reach. From this vantage point we can see the good things development brings as well as the pitfalls they may be walking into.</p>

    <p>This solar project will serve as a pilot project, helping to get the framework in place that will be used to run the much larger and more important coffee project that is already shaping up in the background. It is an opportunity for Wilson to set up templates and train project members before the large sums of money come in. He will be able establish financial controls, making sure money is collected, accounted for, then taken weekly into town to the project bank account. It is also a good way to figure out the trustworthiness of each project member in these early stages.</p>

    <h3>The Importance of Electricity</h3>

    <p>I decided I’d like to install a standalone solar system in the village because, as a renewables/energy efficiency-focused electrician, it’s something I believe in, and can easily do. Wilson was planning (and still is if I can’t get the funds) to buy a small petrol generator for the project headquarters. The generators available in PNG are of terrible quality, very inefficient, spew fumes, and need someone to go into town regularly to get fuel. Despite this, they are the only affordable option at this early stage of the project. I want to help the project start using clean energy from the begining and eventually figure out a way to get the entire village onto a clean energy source (preferably hydro, more on that in another email).</p>

    <p>Electricity is fundamental to the success of the project for a number of reasons. First of all, whilst not specifically profit driven, if the project is going to be successful and above all sustainable, it will need to be run like a business. A key aspect of every business is good record keeping, particularly in regards to meetings, decisions, and of course financials. All efficient businesses these days are run with computers which, of course, need electricity. Excel spreadsheets and other templates can be set up and the project members taught how to use them to keep accountable records.</p>

    <p>Secondly, and also very importantly, Wilson is one of the few people from his village with a greater than 8th grade education and an understanding of computers and business. Unfortunately he is often away on work and especially in the beginning, he will need daily communication with the project members to monitor and provide guidance when needed. A laptop with a reliable internet connection can be used to keep and upload daily records. It will also give other project members an understanding of how to run a business.</p>

    <p>Thirdly, there is already a market for electricity and an understanding in the village around paying for electricity to charge mobile phones. This can easily be utilised as a way of generating income to pay back the loans. I have talked to Wilson about only running the charging station during the day so excess solar energy is used that might otherwise be wasted once the battery system is full. It will also avoid the problem of directly competing with the businesses of night time TV/DVD house owners in the village.</p>

    <p>That pretty much covers the solar project idea but as a bit of an aside I’d just like to make a few more points.</p>

    <p>In a speech to the village in 2015, I talked about the wantok system. The wantok system is not being used to help those less fortunate when they genuinely need it. It is being abused by greedy individuals who see other people with a little extra material wealth and want it for themselves without having to work for it. Wilson and I both believe this is a major problem in the PNG culture that is holding back the progress of everyone. It has harboured the handout mentality, creating laziness and dependency. Its abuse needs to be removed.</p>

    <p>Hopefully the coffee project can create an environment that fosters an attitude of working to benefit all. If so, what is bound to follow is a higher sense of fulfilment that only this kind of altruistic effort can bring. That is the true spirit of the wantok system.</p>

    <p>On another level, I also hope people reading this might think about the way they donate their money. When hearing of projects in developing countries, it seems to me that when external funding is used to set up a school or clinic or something of that nature, there isn’t much thought put into setting up the mechanisms needed so the locals can eventually maintain and run these institutions themselves. There is no economy set up to generate income to help wean them off perpetual handouts. When external funding dries up, skilled outsiders leave along with it, and things fall into disrepair. Leaving very little achieved other than teaching people to rely on handouts and wasting good hearted people’s money. It’s a nice feeling donating money, but I strongly believe if people really care, they would want to fix the core problems, which in most cases is the simple fact that a lot of people in developing countries with limited education and exposure to the outside world, just don’t know how to help themselves or even where to start. I’m not claiming to be an expert by any measure. I am only giving an opinion based on my observations whilst traveling and to a large extent, observations of how our “developed” societies are run.</p>

    <p>Wilson is taking on a huge task. Getting the whole village to believe in doing something to help themselves and work toward it won’t be easy but with his drive and commitment, and hopefully a bit of outside help he will give it a bloody good crack!!!!</p>

    <p>Thanks, and again, if you are planning to loan and become a supporter please do it now before it slowly makes its way to the bottom of your inbox and gets forgotten.</p>

    <h2>The Backstory</h2>

    <p>This is a rundown of how I came to be in Anengu village and how that village is doing something unique in PNG. They are trying to bring themselves out of a purely subsistence way of life and into modern world. I say ‘bring themselves’ deliberately, because that is exactly what they are doing.</p>

    <p>With every PNG government department rotten to the core and no money reaching its outlying people for health, education, electricity, roads etc., and banks unwilling to lend them money, they have no access to finance to buy the tools and equipment needed to work their land, harvest and process its produce, and sustain an income. They are stuck in a very primitive existence.</p>

    <blockquote class="pull-left">
      Most importantly they have ownership of their land and a life of total freedom incomprehensible to most of us working away everyday for the bossman.
    </blockquote>

    <p>They still live in bush material houses and cook only by fire but they do have some small glimpses of the modern world and what it has to offer. Every weekend they send around a collection and put in what small money they have from selling their garden produce, then send someone the four hour walk to the highway junction to buy fuel. The fuel is used to run a generator that powers a TV, so they can beam in the NRL footy games and watch trash Hollywood action DVD’s. It’s entertaining, but the NRL also comes with loads of ads trying to sell them all sorts of crap they ‘need’ like dishwashers, holidays and tin fish (which is literally cat food grade in PNG).</p>

    <img class="pull-right" src="https://uproute-images.s3.amazonaws.com/final-call/solar-powered-coffee/3.jpg" alt="Guy with the Anengu future" />

    <p>Unfortunately this picture of the outside world is what they use as their basis for comparison. Because they don’t have a dishwasher and can’t buy new clothes they really do get the sense of being incredibly poor. This is true to an extent but only in terms of cash. They are not poor like a huge amount of Papuans who have left their land looking for jobs and cash (and dishwashers) in the city. Those Papuan’s end up with nowhere to live, no garden to grow food, and no access to clean water — leaving them with few options other than begging or crime to survive.</p>

    <p>While it’s true that the Village people have very little cash, they do have homes, gardens full of food all year round and endless clean drinking water. Most importantly they have ownership of their land and a life of total freedom incomprehensible to most of us working away everyday for the bossman.</p>

    <p>They do need the benefits that modern development brings but they also need to be mindful of its negative aspects too. Some negative things that are already very slightly showing up in the village are alcoholism, gambling, and buying cheap plastic goods and single use batteries that end up littered around the village. I worry that without some direction and a strong central village leadership they might head further down the wrong path.</p>

    <p>I guess my biggest hope is that they will get an understanding of what parts of development are really important to a happy life and a connected community, and what is just the flashy ‘nice to have’ peripheral shit that doesn’t have any long term benefit.</p>

    <p>Before I go into the coffee project I’ll just give an explaination of how I came to be in PNG and the village. If you’re already bored and just want to know how the project works then skip this paragraph.</p>

    <h3 id="the-backstory">The (Even Further) Backstory</h3>

    <p>In 2012 I decided that I wanted to go somewhere really off the beaten track and totally unexplored by tourists. I hate to say it but a huge chunk of my previous travel has been bouncing from one lonely planet ‘must see’ to the next getting drunk with other backpackers. While it was heaps of fun there wasn’t really much fulfillment in it and I didn’t balance it as well as I’d like to have with the original intentions of my travel.</p>

    <blockquote>
      On landing in Port Moresby and leaving the airport into what seemed like a war zone I arrived at my security-gated and guarded hotel.
    </blockquote>

    <p>I guess naively, like most young backpackers, I thought I’d being going to exotic countries, meeting the locals, being invited into their homes and experiencing what its like to live in a different culture. The reality being the only locals I could talk to had learnt English for the sole purpose of selling you a Rolax or a tailored suit.</p>

    <p>I wanted to really test my comfort zone and PNG seemed like the spot. It turned out to be just that and much more. On landing in Port Moresby and leaving the airport into what seemed like a war zone I arrived at my security gated and guarded hotel. I was definitely a bit nervous and after three days of not seeing another tourist I was starting to think maybe I’d bitten off more than I could chew. The only thing I had booked for the whole three months was a stay at the alternative technologies center in the highland town of Garoka and was pretty glad to be on my way out of Moresby four days after arrival.</p>

    <img src="https://uproute-images.s3.amazonaws.com/final-call/solar-powered-coffee/5.jpg" alt="Guy with Wilson" />

    <p>On the flight to Garoka I was lucky enough to be seated next to a PNG local whose English was better than mine. He told me he was on the way back to his village for the first time in three years. His village was called <strong>Anengu</strong> which is a two-hour drive from Garoka when it’s dry, or a one-hour drive followed by a four-hour uphill walk to the edge of the jungle if it’s been raining and the road is to muddy to drive.</p>

    <p>He told me he was the only person from his village to ever be university educated, and the village was having a feast to welcome him back. With a fair amount of apprehension over the lack of plumbing and electricity, he invited me to come and experience life in his village. He said I would be the first non-missionary white person to visit the village and that many of the kids under 10 would have never seen a white fella.</p>

    <p>I was a little nervous and did think that maybe no more white fellas go there cause the last one was eaten. Still, it sounded like an awesome opportunity to see how the locals <em>really</em> live. Worth the risk I thought.</p>

    <img class="pull-left" src="https://uproute-images.s3.amazonaws.com/final-call/solar-powered-coffee/6.jpg" alt="Guy with Wilson" />

    <p>It turned out to be the best risk I’ve ever taken. The village was amazingly beautiful and the people were unbelievably welcoming. After spending three days eating what they eat (which included a traditional feast of a whole pig cooked in the traditional way) sleeping on bamboo platforms next to them and learning Pidgin English, I felt very comfortable there. They were also very comfortable with me and before I was about to leave many of the village men came up to me and offered to give me some land and build me a bush material hut so I could come back whenever I wanted. I thanked them for the offer but told them I wanted to go and see a bit more of PNG.</p>

    <p>After going away that night and thinking about it, I realised this was exactly the kind of traveling experience I’d always wanted. In the end I went back to the village and spent a month there building my own bush material hut.</p>

    <h3>The Anengu Coffee Project</h3>

    <p>It was such an awesome experience that I had to invite my dad and brother over to come and see the place. While they were in the village we organised for some of the young men and boys to guide us on a trek to Wessan, a village much further into the jungle where many of the Anengu residents are originally from.</p>

    <p>If a Papuan tells you they walk it in 10 hours, assume it will take you 25 hours. The terrain is insanely rugged and they literally travel barefoot at almost a jogging pace. It’s hard to understand how rugged and wild it is unless you go but these guys really live on the edge of the world. once you go past Anengu it is steep mountainous, almost untouched jungle for days and days of walking. The whole 2 months in the highlands was definitely a highlight of my life and something I’ll always think back on. A huge part of it being the kind of cultural experience I’ve always wanted but never really been able to find anywhere else.</p>

    <blockquote class="pull-right">

    </blockquote>

    <p>I had many conversations with Wilson about how he could help bring a better life to the people of his village. We emailed a bit on this subject after I left and as time went by he became more disheartened and frustrated about the situation. In an email to my father and I, he asked us if we could help find him work so that he could earn more money and send it back to his village. My father and I both wrote separate emails along similar lines, the crux of it being that there wasn’t really any point earning more money just to give it away, because no matter how much he earn’t he couldn’t support a village of 300 people. If he kept up the handouts there’d be nothing left for him and his family.</p>

    <p>I don’t believe in unconditional handouts, I think it fosters laziness and creates dependency and I think he was setting himself up for a long struggle. About six months after that email I received another email from Wilson, this time with a completely different tone. I’m not sure who he had been talking to and how he got the idea but he had decided to put his life savings into a coffee project so he could get the whole village involved and teach them how to help themselves.</p>

    <img class="pull-left" src="https://uproute-images.s3.amazonaws.com/final-call/solar-powered-coffee/11.jpg" alt="The Anengu Coffee Project" />

    <p>Wilson’s entire life savings was a total of about $7,000 — which might not sound like much, but it is a huge sum for the average Papuan. He used that money to buy 100,000 coffee seedlings and planter bags, then had the village people build a huge bush material nursery so that the seedlings could be looked after until they were strong enough to plant. At this point he had run out of money so contacted me to see if I could help with some small money to buy fertilizer to ensure the seedlings had the best start possible. After seeing the pictures of nursery and knowing what it could mean to the village I talked to Dad and we both decided to help them purchase the needed fertilizer.</p>

    <h3 id="how-the-project-will-work">How the project will work</h3>

    <p>It had been almost three years since my first visit and I had been wanting to get back there ever since. I decided that now was a great time to go and see the village and find out a bit more detail about their project. When I arrived in the village little had changed from my previous visit, especially the people, who were as welcoming and warm hearted as ever. Of course one notable change was the huge nursery full of little coffee plants. Even though I’d seen pictures of it the scale amazed me.</p>

    <p>Even more Impressive though was the structure of the project itself which was what I was most interested in. As I said before, my fear was that with the project there would be quite a bit of money coming into the village, but without leadership it might do more harm than good.</p>

    <p>Wilson had also considered this and decided to set up a charter and a committee to administer the funds of the project. The main focus of the charter is to bring basic services to the village in a sustainable way. The main things he’s identified are looking into some basic health care in the form of a clinic visited periodically by a nurse.</p>

    <img src="https://uproute-images.s3.amazonaws.com/final-call/solar-powered-coffee/12.jpg" alt="The Anengu Coffee Project" />

    <p>He also included subsidised education for the younger generation and getting some form of electricity in the village that isn’t a petrol generator, among other things. All these things we in developed countries consider the responsibility of Government. In Anengu, they don’t have any meaningful access to these basic things so must work together to bring it to themselves.
    ​
    <blockquote class="pull-left">
      So far there has been limited funding as government funding in PNG tends to disappear without anything to show for it.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Wilson also launched the project and registered it with the provincial government. So far there has been limited funding as government funding in PNG tends to disappear without anything to show for it. They have however provided some drying canvases and some coffee bean processing machines. Hopefully once the land has been prepared and the seedlings planted, the government will see that the villagers are serious and willing to work, and the money is actually being used as intended, there will be a bit more funding made available.</p>

    <p>Basically how the project will work is that Wilson will give each village family a share of the seedlings free of charge, which they will have to plant on their land. Wilson studied agriculture at university and is teaching the villagers how to tend their plots and plants to get the maximum yield. He will periodically inspect them and give prizes for the best plots.</p>

    <img class="pull-right" src="https://uproute-images.s3.amazonaws.com/final-call/solar-powered-coffee/13.jpg" alt="The Anengu Coffee Project" />

    <p>This has already been done since I left. It takes 3 years for the seedlings to mature and fruit. In the meantime he is trying to get all the villagers to start pooling some money to take the project to the next level. This is where the project will either succeed and start producing revenue, or it will fail.</p>

    <p>At the moment the villagers only process the coffee to parchment stage which means removing the husk and drying it on large canvases called parchments. They then individually sell it to factories in town to get about 4 kina/kg (approximately 2 Kina = $1.00). The aim of the project is to eventually get a machine that process the beans to the next stage of refinement, which is the green bean stage.</p>

    <p>Instead of the villagers selling the parchment beans in town they would now sell them back to the Anengu Coffee
    Project to process. The project pays the villagers the same 4 kina/kg for the parchment they harvest, then processes it to green bean, and sells it to the exporters in bulk for 7 kina/kg. The 3 kina profit they make goes directly into the project account.</p>

    <img src="https://uproute-images.s3.amazonaws.com/final-call/solar-powered-coffee/14.jpg" alt="The Anengu Coffee Project" />

    <p>This way the villagers each get money to do with what they please in return for their hard work, and the project also starts getting an independent revenue stream which will cover operational costs and hopefully have plenty left over to fulfill the aims of the project charter.</p>

    <img class="pull-left" src="https://uproute-images.s3.amazonaws.com/final-call/solar-powered-coffee/15.jpg" alt="The Anengu Coffee Project" />

    <p>Since the last visit all the seedlings have been planted and the last email I received this week showed them standing in front of 47 x 60 kg bags from this years harvest of the existing trees. As coffee is seasonal, Wilson has encouraged the villagers to use the money to buy vegetable seeds and chickens. The reason for this is to diversify the crop and to produce some income all year round with the vegetables and to use the chickens to keep down pests and reduce or eliminate the need for any manufactured fertilizers. It is already an incredible achievement for a man who grew up in one of the remotest places on earth.</p>

    <blockquote>
      I am very very excited and proud when I think of the possibilities and that it’s 100% owned and driven by the villagers.
    </blockquote>

    <p>They still have a long way to go but they have some very strong leaders on the project and if they all pull together I think they will create a better life for the entire village and set an example to other Papuans.</p>
